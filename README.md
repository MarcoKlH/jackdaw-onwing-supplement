# jackdaw-onwing-supplement
Supplementary code supporting a statement about high span efficiency found in gliding flight [data from KleinHeerenbrink, M., Warfvinge, K. &amp; Hedenström, A. 2016 Wake analysis of aerodynamic components for the glide envelope of a jackdaw (Corvus monedula). J. Exp. Biol. 219, 1572–1581. (doi:10.1242/jeb.132480)]

This repository holds a short code that reanalyses the data from the gliding jackdaw to support the statement that when excluding the effects of the tail, span efficiency of the main wing is up to 6% more efficient than a planar wing. The code is for *MATLAB*. Simply run the file *runAnalysis.m*.
